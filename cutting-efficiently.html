    <p>CalSaw’s focus is on providing a product that solves problems. If you’re looking to increase volume, our saws have shown an ability to last longer, minimizing unscheduled saw changes. If your goal is to produce a higher-grade product, our saws are an easy way to immediately reduce planer skip and improve sawing accuracy. If you want more product and lower overall costs, our thin saw plates offer an opportunity for a reduced kerf, providing more boards and higher revenue.</p>

    <h1>Measuring Success</h1>
    <p>Monitoring how far your dollar goes and how much value it is providing is at the forefront of any decision. When it comes to choosing the right saw, measuring its impact on production can help determine whether any adjustments need to be made. How much benching is required? What is your current level of production and what would you like to get to? How often are you experiencing unscheduled saw changes? How consistent are your board measurements? Are you experiencing any snaking, wedging, or tapers? How often is there planer skip?</p>
    <p>Collecting measurements to answer each of these questions guides you to areas of untapped potential. CalSaw can help brainstorm/engineer a solution to tap into that potential and make sure you reach your goals.</p>
