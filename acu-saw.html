    <ul>
      <li>Adaptor can be configured to accommodate lobe (Retec) or involute style splines</li>
      <li>A simple snap on is all that’s required to mount a saw on an Acu Saw</li>
      <li>Pre-loaded, hardened pins engage the spline of the saw to ensure the saw is clamped at an accurate center</li>
      <li>The Acu Saw compensates for imperfections in the spline such as inaccurately indexed lobes, oval eyes, or uneven wear</li>
      <li>The movable parts in the adaptor are separated sufficiently so as to allow grinding dust to be flushed away without affecting the mechanism</li>
    </ul>
