    <h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
    <p>Since 1886, Cal Saw’s promise to customers has been to research, develop, and deliver the most advanced technology for a diverse range of cutting needs. Throughout the four generations of family stewardship, and now the collaboration with Roseburg Saw & Tool under the new ownership of Dan Lines, we’ve remained firmly rooted in the science and engineering of saws, knives, wood machining and food processing in order to keep that promise and help your business succeed.</p>
